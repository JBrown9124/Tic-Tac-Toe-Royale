# Tic-Tac-Toe-Royale
Created a full-stack online Tic-Tac-Toe web game with a twist. Acquire and use powers to dominate your enemies. Set the board size, board color, “win by” condition (amount of pieces in a row required to win) and pieces (upload custom piece capability included). Capable of having up to 100 players in a single game. Full bot functionality (add up to 10 AI per board). Client was created with TypeScript React.js, the REST API with Python (Django), and real-time client updates are handled with Socket.IO.
